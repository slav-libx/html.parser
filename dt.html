<dd>
    Indicate that the activity can be launched as the embedded child of another
    activity. Particularly in the case where the child lives in a container
    such as a Display owned by another activity. For example, activities
    that are used for Wear custom notifications must declare this so
    Wear can display the activity in it's context stream, which resides
    in another process.

    <p>The default value of this attribute is <code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>.
</dd>
<dt><a name="reparent"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:allowTaskReparenting</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can move from the task that started it to
the task it has an affinity for when that task is next brought to the
front &mdash; "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>" if it can move, and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>" if it
must remain with the task where it started.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute of the <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element
applies to the activity.  The default value is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>".
</p>

<p>
Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of
the activity that started it and it stays there for its entire lifetime.
You can use this attribute to force it to be re-parented to the task it
has an affinity for when its current task is no longer displayed.
Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to move
to the main task associated with that application.
</p>

<p>
For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking
the link brings up an activity that can display the page.  That activity
is defined by the browser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail
task.  If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the
browser next comes to the front, and will be absent when the e-mail task
again comes forward.
</p>

<p>
The affinity of an activity is defined by the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a></code> attribute.  The affinity
of a task is determined by reading the affinity of its root activity.
Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the
same affinity.  Since activities with "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTask</code>" or
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleInstance</code>" launch modes can only be at the root of a task,
re-parenting is limited to the "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>"
modes.  (See also the <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="#lmode">launchMode</a></code>
attribute.)
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="always"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:alwaysRetainTaskState</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the state of the task that the activity is in will always
be maintained by the system &mdash; "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>" if it will be, and
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>" if the system is allowed to reset the task to its initial
state in certain situations.  The default value is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>".  This
attribute is meaningful only for the root activity of a task; it's ignored
for all other activities.

<p>
Normally, the system clears a task (removes all activities from the stack
above the root activity) in certain situations when the user re-selects that
task from the home screen.  Typically, this is done if the user hasn't visited
the task for a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
However, when this attribute is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>", users will always return
to the task in its last state, regardless of how they get there.  This is
useful, for example, in an application like the web browser where there is
a lot of state (such as multiple open tabs) that users would not like to lose.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="autoremrecents"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:autoRemoveFromRecents</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not tasks launched by activities with this attribute remains in the
<a href="/guide/components/recents">overview screen</a> until the last activity in the
task is completed. If <code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>, the task is
automatically removed from the overview screen. This overrides the caller's use of
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS">FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS</a></code>. It must be a boolean value, either

<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">&lt;application&gt;</code></a>
tag to supply a banner for all application activities.

<p>The system uses the banner to represent an app in
the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it
should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER">CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER</a></code> intent.</p>

<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"@drawable/banner"</code>). There is no default banner.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="/training/tv/start/start#banner">
Provide a home screen banner</a> in Get Started with TV Apps for more information.
</p></dd>


<dt><a name="clear"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:clearTaskOnLaunch</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not all activities will be removed from the task, except for
the root activity, whenever it is re-launched from the home screen &mdash;
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>" if the task is always stripped down to its root activity, and
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>" if not.  The default value is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>".  This attribute
is meaningful only for activities that start a new task (the root activity);
it's ignored for all other activities in the task.

<p>
When the value is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>", every time users start the task again, they
are brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing in
the task and regardless of whether they used the <em>Back</em> or <em>Home</em> button to
leave it. When the value is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>", the task may be cleared of activities in
some situations (see the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="#always">alwaysRetainTaskState</a></code> attribute), but not always.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home screen,
and from there goes to activity Q.  The user next presses <em>Home</em>, and then returns
to activity P.  Normally, the user would see activity Q, since that is what they
were last doing in P's task.  However, if P set this flag to "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>", all
of the activities on top of it (Q in this case) were removed when the user pressed
<em>Home</em> and the task went to the background.  So the user sees only P when returning
to the task.
</p>

<p>
If this attribute and <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>", any activities that can be re-parented are moved to
the task they share an affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped,
as described above.

<p>Starting from Android 3.0, a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is
available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics
operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations
in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated.
This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved
responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use
the framework's OpenGL libraries. Because of the increased resources required to
enable hardware acceleration, your app will consume more RAM.</p>

<p>Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable
the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can
make use of the renderer without errors.</p>

<dt><a name="lmode"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:launchMode</code></dt>
<dd>An instruction on how the activity should be launched.  There are four modes
that work in conjunction with activity flags (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">FLAG_ACTIVITY_*</code> constants)
in <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent">Intent</a></code> objects to determine what should happen when
the activity is called upon to handle an intent. They are:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>"
<br>"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>"
<br>"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTask</code>"
<br>"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleInstance</code>"</p>

<p>
The default mode is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>".
</p>

<p>
As shown in the table below, the modes fall into two main groups, with
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>" activities on one side, and
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTask</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleInstance</code>" activities on the other.
An activity with the "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>" or "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>" launch mode
can be instantiated multiple times.  The instances can belong to any task
and can be located anywhere in the activity stack.  Typically, they're
launched into the task that called
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Context#startActivity(android.content.Intent)">startActivity()</a></code></code>
(unless the Intent object contains a
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
instruction, in which case a different task is chosen &mdash; see the
<a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a> attribute).
</p>

<p>
In contrast, "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTask</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleInstance</code>" activities
can only begin a task.  They are always at the root of the activity stack.
Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time
&mdash; only one such task.
</p>

<p>
The "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>" modes differ from each other
in just one respect:  Every time there's a new intent for a "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>"
activity, a new instance of the class is created to respond to that intent.
Each instance handles a single intent.
Similarly, a new instance of a "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>" activity may also be
created to handle a new intent.  However, if the target task already has an
existing instance of the activity at the top of its stack, that instance
will receive the new intent (in an
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code> call);
a new instance is not created.
In other circumstances &mdash; for example, if an existing instance of the
"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>" activity is in the target task, but not at the top of
the stack, or if it's at the top of a stack, but not in the target task
&mdash; a new instance would be created and pushed on the stack.
</p>

<p>Similarly, if you
<a href="/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral">navigate
up</a> to an activity on the current stack, the behavior is determined by the
parent activity's launch mode. If the parent activity has launch mode <code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code> (or the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">up</code> intent contains <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the parent is brought to the
top of the stack, and its state is preserved. The navigation intent is received
by the parent activity's <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code>
method.  If the parent activity has launch mode <code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code> (and the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">up</code> intent does not contain <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the current activity and its
parent are both popped off the stack, and a new instance of the parent activity
is created to receive the navigation intent.
</p>


<p>
The "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTask</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleInstance</code>" modes also differ from
each other in only one respect:  A "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTask</code>" activity allows other
activities to be part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but
other activities (necessarily "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">standard</code>" and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleTop</code>"
activities) can be launched into that task.  A "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">singleInstance</code>"
activity, on the other hand, permits no other activities to be part of its task.
It's the only activity in the task.  If it starts another activity, that
activity is assigned to a different task &mdash; as if <code translate="no" dir="ltr">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</code> was in the intent.

Maximum aspect ratio is expressed as the decimal form of the quotient of the device's longer

set the value of this attribute to 2.33.

On non-wearable devices, the value of this attribute needs to be 1.33 or greater.
On wearable devices, it must be 1.0 or greater. Otherwise, the system ignores the

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you declare one of the landscape or portrait values,
it is considered a hard requirement for the orientation in which the activity runs. As such,
the value you declare enables filtering by services such as Google Play so your application is
available only to devices that support the orientation required by your activities. For
example, if you declare either <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"landscape"</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"reverseLandscape"</code>, or
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">"sensorLandscape"</code>, then your application will be available only to devices that support
landscape orientation. However, you should also explicitly declare that
your application requires either portrait or landscape orientation with the <a
href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></a>
element. For example, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">&lt;uses-feature
android:name="android.hardware.screen.portrait"/></code>. This is purely a filtering behavior
provided by Google Play (and other services that support it) and the platform itself does not
control whether your app can be installed when a device supports only certain orientations.</p>

<dt><a name="showForAllUsers"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:showForAllUsers</code></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Whether or not the activity is shown when the device's current user is
  different than the user who launched the activity. You can set this attribute
  to a literal value&mdash;<code translate="no" dir="ltr">"true"</code> or <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"false"</code>&mdash;or
  you can set the attribute to a resource or theme attribute that contains a
  boolean value.</p>

  <p>This attribute was added in API level 23.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="state"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:stateNotNeeded</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can be killed and successfully restarted
without having saved its state &mdash; "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>" if it can be restarted
without reference to its previous state, and "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>" if its previous
state is required.  The default value is "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">false</code>".

<p>
Normally, before an activity is temporarily shut down to save resources, its
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code></code>
method is called.  This method stores the current state of the activity in a
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/os/Bundle">Bundle</a></code> object, which is then passed to
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)">onCreate()</a></code></code> when the activity
is restarted.  If this attribute is set to "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>",
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">onSaveInstanceState()</code> may not be called and <code translate="no" dir="ltr">onCreate()</code> will
be passed <code translate="no" dir="ltr">null</code> instead of the Bundle &mdash; just as it was when the
activity started for the first time.
</p>

<p>
A "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">true</code>" setting ensures that the activity can be restarted in the
absence of retained state.  For example, the activity that displays the
home screen uses this setting to make sure that it does not get removed if it
crashes for some reason.

</dd>

<dt><a name="aff"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:taskAffinity</code></dt>
<dd>The task that the activity has an affinity for.  Activities with
the same affinity conceptually belong to the same task (to the same
"application" from the user's perspective).  The affinity of a task
is determined by the affinity of its root activity.

<p>
The affinity determines two things &mdash; the task that the activity is re-parented
to (see the <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute) and the task that will house the activity when it is launched
with the <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
flag.
</p>

<p>
By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity.  You
can set this attribute to group them differently, and even place
activities defined in different applications within the same task.  To
specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, set
it to an empty string.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the affinity set
for the application (see the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#aff">taskAffinity</a></code>
attribute).  The name of the default affinity for an application is
the package name set by the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code>
element.
</p>

<dt><a name="theme"></a><code translate="no" dir="ltr">android:theme</code></dt>
<dd>A reference to a style resource defining an overall theme for the activity.
This automatically sets the activity's context to use this theme (see
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/reference/android/content/Context#setTheme(int)">setTheme()</a></code></code>, and may also
cause "starting" animations prior to the activity being launched (to better
match what the activity actually looks like).

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the theme set for the
application as a whole &mdash; from the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#theme">theme</a></code>
attribute.  If that attribute is also not set, the default system theme is used. For more
information, see the <a

<dd>How the main window of the activity interacts with the window containing
the on-screen soft keyboard.  The setting for this attribute affects two
things:

<ul>
<li>The state of the soft keyboard &mdash; whether it is hidden or visible
&mdash; when the activity becomes the focus of user attention.</li>

<li>The adjustment made to the activity's main window &mdash; whether it is
resized smaller to make room for the soft keyboard or whether its contents
pan to make the current focus visible when part of the window is covered by
the soft keyboard.</li>

"<code translate="no" dir="ltr">state...</code>" values, for example &mdash; has undefined results.
Individual values are separated by a vertical bar (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">|</code>).  For example:
